# Collocations (NLTK)

Collocations extracted from text files and processed using NLTK.
The CSV files contain the output, where 'freq' is the frequency list, and 'collocations' - the list of collocations with values for 4 mesasures.
'colloc.py' contains the code.

NB: Note that pmi and chi_sq measures cannot be used to create frequency lists.
